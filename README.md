# Oral-Cancer-Prediction-Website

Introduction
This website was created to predict locoregional recurrence in patients with 
Oral Tongue Squamous Cancer Carcinoma (OTSCC) in early-stage.

Data
The data included 5 teaching hospitals in Finland and 1 hospital from Sao Paulo in Brazil.
The data contained 11 prognostic parameters as inputs and locoregional recurrence as output.

Method
A webtool was developed that involved the use of machine learning algorithm to predict oral cancer.

Conference Presentation
The abstracts on the use of machine learning to predict OTSCC by the above website had been accepted
for presentation at two- international conferences:
6th Global Conference on Artificial Neural Network.
A2IC- 1st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Barcelona.
